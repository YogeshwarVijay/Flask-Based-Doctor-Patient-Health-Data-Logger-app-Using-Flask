                <p> <b>Salt-water gargle:</b>
                    This simple remedy is one of the most effective for treating
                    a sore throat and wet cough. 
                    Salt water reduces phlegm and mucus in the back of the throat
                    which can lessen the need to cough.
                    Stir half a teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water until it dissolves.
                    Allow the solution to cool slightly before using it to gargle.
                    Let the mixture sit at the back of the throat for a 
                    few moments before spitting it out. 
                    Gargle with salt water several times each day until the cough improves.
                    Avoid giving salt water to younger children as they may not be able
                    to gargle properly, and swallowing salt water can be dangerous.

                <p> <b>Drink lots of fluids:</b>
                    When you’re sick, mucus can trickle down the back of your nose. 
                    Staying hydrated thins the drip so it’s less likely to irritate
                    your throat and trigger a cough. 
                    This also makes it easier for your lungs to clear out the discharge.
                    What’s more, a parched body may push your immune system to release 
                    more histamines. These chemicals swell your nose and make more mucus,
                    which can set off a cough.

                    It can ease cold symptoms, including a cough.
                    The liquids are hydrating, and the heat helps to lower congestion.
                    Brew some calming chamomile tea. Ginger tea is another good choice. 
                    The spicy root may help relax the smooth muscles in your airways.
                    Steep chopped ginger in boiling water for 5-10 minutes and
                    discard before sipping.

            <div class="card-body">
                <p> <b>Drinking lots of fluids:</b>
                    During a fever, the body needs to use more water to compensate
                    for its elevated temperature. This can lead to dehydration.
                    Drinking water or an electrolyte replacement drink can help
                    rehydrate the body.
